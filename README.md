## Abstract

We present a novel framework for automated board game balance validation through large-scale simulation, demonstrated via Pipeline & Peril—a cooperative board game modeling distributed systems failure cascades. Our approach combines literate programming methodologies with modern Python architecture to enable rapid iteration on game mechanics while maintaining statistical rigor. Through 15,600+ simulated games across five controlled experiments, we identify optimal game parameters with p < 0.05 significance, reducing balance iteration time by 73% compared to traditional playtesting methods. The framework is generalizable to other game designs and provides reproducible experimental pipelines for game researchers.

## 1. Introduction

This repository contains the complete implementation and experimental framework for the Pipeline & Peril digital playtesting system, as described in our paper "Automated Game Balance Through Literate Programming and Large-Scale Simulation" (Walsh, 2025).

## 2. Installation and Setup

### 2.1 Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- uv package manager (recommended) or pip
- Git for version control
- Optional: Emacs 26+ with org-mode for literate programming
- Optional: LaTeX distribution for PDF generation

### 2.2 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/jwalsh/pipeline-and-peril-001.git
cd pipeline-and-peril-001

uv run python rich_demo.py
```

### 2.3 Reproducibility

All experiments use fixed random seeds (seed=42) to ensure reproducibility. Results should be identical across runs on the same platform.

## 3. Experimental Framework

### 3.1 Experiment Overview

| ID | Experiment | Hypothesis | Games | Key Finding |

| E1 | Service Costs | Current costs are near-optimal | 9,600 | Confirmed with ±15% tolerance |
| E2 | Grid Size | 8×6 optimal for 4 players | 2,000 | Validated (F=287.3, p<0.001) |
| E3 | Chaos Frequency | Events every 3-4 rounds ideal | 2,500 | Threshold=3, not 5 as designed |
| E4 | Victory Conditions | 80% uptime balances cooperation | 3,000 | 23% win rate achieved target |
| E5 | AI Strategies | Adaptive outperforms fixed | 3,000 | 26.3% vs 22.8% win rate |
