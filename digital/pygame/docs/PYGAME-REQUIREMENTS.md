# Pipeline & Peril - Digital Playtesting Requirements

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for a PyGame-based digital version of Pipeline & Peril, designed specifically for rapid playtesting, rules validation, and game balance evaluation. The system will support both autonomous AI-driven gameplay and human interaction, with optional integration to LLM agents via Ollama.

## Project Overview

### Purpose
Create a digital playtesting environment to:
- Validate game mechanics and balance
- Test edge cases and rule interactions
- Gather statistical data on game outcomes
- Evaluate different strategies
- Accelerate iteration on game design

### Scope
- Core game engine with complete rules implementation
- Autonomous AI players with configurable strategies
- Data collection and analytics
- Optional human player interface
- Optional LLM agent integration

## Game Rules Specification

### Setup Phase
1. Initialize 8x6 hex grid
2. Place 3 starting services (1 Compute, 1 Database, 1 Load Balancer)
3. Each player starts with:
   - 5 CPU, 5 Memory, 5 Storage
   - 3 action tokens
   - Character ability
4. Set uptime to 100%
5. Set entropy to 0

### Turn Structure

#### 1. Traffic Phase
- Roll 2d10 for incoming requests
- Distribute requests to entry points (Load Balancers/API Gateways)
- Check for overload conditions

#### 2. Action Phase (3 actions per player)
Available actions:
- Build Service (cost varies by type)
- Create Connection (1 resource)
- Upgrade Service (2 resources)
- Debug Service (roll d20, DC based on bug severity)
- Deploy Redundancy (copy service)
- Gather Resources (gain 1d6 resources)
- Use Tool Card
- Activate Character Ability

#### 3. Resolution Phase
- Services process requests
- Check for cascade failures
- Calculate uptime changes
- Resolve any triggered events

#### 4. Chaos Phase
- Roll d8 for chaos event (if entropy > 3)
- Apply chaos effects
- Increase entropy by 1 (max 10)

### Service Types and Properties

| Service Type   | CPU | Memory | Storage | Capacity | Special                    |
|----------------|-----|--------|---------|----------|----------------------------|
| Compute        |   2 |      2 |       1 |        5 | Process any request        |
| Database       |   1 |      2 |       3 |        3 | Required for data requests |
| Cache          |   1 |      3 |       1 |        8 | Speed up connected services|
| Queue          |   1 |      1 |       2 |        6 | Buffer overflow            |
| Load Balancer  |   2 |      1 |       1 |       10 | Distribute traffic         |
| API Gateway    |   1 |      1 |       1 |        7 | External entry point       |

### Victory Conditions
- **Cooperative**: Maintain >80% uptime for 10 rounds
- **Competitive**: Highest (uptime Ã— requests handled)
